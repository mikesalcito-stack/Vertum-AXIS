// Enhanced level design:
// - Add branching paths with optional challenges for rewards (e.g., subroutines)
// - Include secret areas accessible via clever rotation or state changes
// - Create multi-layer puzzles combining beams, nodes, and gears across rotations
// - Add dynamic elements: moving platforms (VitrumMovableBlock with timelines), timed gates
// - Fix boring spots: Intersperse collectibles, audio logs (via DialogueManager), and mini-challenges in linear sections
// - Ensure varied pacing: Short flow bursts between solve sections

// Enhanced with:
- Varied terrain: Hills, ramps, valleys using landscape tools
- Banked oval track: Circular path with banked curves for high-speed racing/flow testing
- Fun topology: Loops, jumps, twisty paths integrated with puzzles
- Marble graphics: Update mesh/material for larger, detailed model (e.g., higher poly, glow effects)
- Ensure camera centering prevents losing player in large map

// Further enhancements:
// - Add varied terrain: Hills, ramps, loops using landscape tools or static meshes
// - Create banked oval race track area: Use spline-based paths with banked curves for high-speed flow testing
// - Fun topology: Twisty paths, jumps, tunnels to leverage marble momentum
// - To prevent getting lost: Add auto-centering camera logic in Marble Tick, minimap or waypoints if needed
